After some time attempting to troubleshoot my DLCList Project, I decided to focus my attention elsewhere because I was not making much progress.
Instead, I decided to work on a separate project to review older CS 162 concepts, and I also needed to study for other classes.
It is unfortunate that I did not have the time necessary to complete the project however the underlying learning still took place.
